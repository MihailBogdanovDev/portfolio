  about:
    "I’m a 25-year-old software engineer graduating from the University of Applied Sciences Fontys in Eindhoven. I enjoy building impactful software, learning new technologies, and solving complex problems. I have full-stack experience developing web applications and backend services, and I’m currently focused on applying AI and LLMs to real-world software use cases. \n\I’m completing my graduation internship at Synthgen, where I’m working on CaptureAI—building an image-to-video generation pipeline and a node-based canvas for creating personalized generation workflows. \n\As a hobby sometimes I like to create little side projects. Currently working on creating a 3D Unity Game with a story.",
